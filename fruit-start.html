  WEEK 10 Reading1: CLIENT-SIDE FORM VALIDATION 
        Form Validation is a way a system validates form's data on the user's computer before it is sent to the web server.
        Forms validation checks to make sure that required fields in a form are entered corrected and in the correct format.
        Form validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.
        Three important reasons for validating forms are;
            - To get the right data in the right format
            - To protect the users' data
            - To protect ourselves from malicious users
        There are Two types of client-side validation;
            1. Built-in form validation: This uses HTML5 form validation features.
            2. JavaScript: This validation is created using JavaScript code    
            NOTE: Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript but does not have the flexibility of customization like JavaScript does.

   WEEK 10 Reading2: USING FETCH 
         "Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network."
         The fetch() can be used to;
            - send a request with credentials included
            - upload JSON data
            - upload a single file
            - upload multiple files
            - process a text file line by line
        Respose Objects: These are returned when fetch() promises are resolved. The most common response properties are;
            - Response.status
            - Response.statusText
            - Response.ok which returns a Boolean(True/False)
            We can check for Fetch API support by checking for the existence of Headers, Request, Response or fetch() on the window
            We can also use Fetch in nsupported browsers by using the Fetch Polifill which recreates the functionality for non-suppoerting browsers.
        Headers: A headers object is a simple multi-map of values names
        Headers interface allows for the creation of headers object using the Headers() constructor

               fail silently when used with a number field.
