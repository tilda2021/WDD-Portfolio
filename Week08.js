CHAPTER 8: CSS3 TRANSFORMS AND TRANSITIONS
CHAPTER 12: CANVAS, SVG, AND DRAG AND DROP

The transform property makes it possible to translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any elements on a page.
Transform functions can be used to manipulate element's appearance. 

Translation functions makes it possible to move elements up and down, left and right. The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:
transform: translate(45px, -45px);

Scaling: The scale(x,y) function sclaes elements by the defined factors horizontally and vertically.

Rotation: Rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.

Skew: The skew(x, y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes

    - animation-name
    - animation-duration
Animation-timing-function: Determines how the animation will progress over its duration
Animation-iteration-count: Used to define how many times an animation will play through
Animation-direction: Used to change the behaviour of an element
